This is the repo for the book on review of basic electrical engineering principles mostly for Integrated Circuit & Electronic System designers. This book follows Tufte-style typesetting from Edward Tufte's books.  This repo is forked from the Tufte LaTeX package at https://github.com/Tufte-LaTeX/tufte-latex.

### Self-publish
- Edward Tufte's [Book design thread](https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000hB) has some great stuff on typography and book design. A must checkout.
- [Ask ET Forum](https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/) is the general forum with all questions.
- Robert Ghirst on [self-publishing on Amazon](https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/whyselfpublish.html) is a must read as well.

## Documentation on the tufte-latex package.
The following documention is from the tufte-latex's README.md
Welcome to the beginnings of Tufte LaTeX package to help you
produce Tufte-style handouts, reports, and notes.

## Quick Start

Try typesetting `sample-handout.tex` with the following sequence
of commands,

    pdflatex sample-handout
    bibtex   sample-handout
    pdflatex sample-handout
    pdflatex sample-handout

The result should look like `sample-handout.pdf`.

The sample book can be compiled with the following:

    pdflatex sample-book
    bibtex sample-book
    texindy --language english sample-book.idx
    # or makeindex sample-book.idx
    pdflatex sample-book
    pdflatex sample-book
    pdflatex sample-book

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors of the form,

    ! LaTeX Error: File `paralist.sty' not found.

you will need to obtain missing packages from [CTAN](http://ctan.org).
For package installation instructions and answers to many other
questions, see the [UK TeX FAQ](http://www.tex.ac.uk/faq/) or search the [`comp.text.tex` group](http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex).

The following packages are required:

 * chngpage or changepage
 * fancyhdr
 * fontenc
 * geometry
 * hyperref
 * natbib and bibentry
 * optparams
 * paralist
 * placeins
 * ragged2e
 * setspace
 * textcase
 * textcomp
 * titlesec
 * titletoc
 * xcolor
 * xifthen

The following packages are optional and will be automatically used if installed:

 * beramono
 * helvet
 * ifpdf
 * ifxetex
 * letterspace (in the microtype package)
 * mathpazo
 * soul
